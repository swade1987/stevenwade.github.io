Welcome to my new website which is based on the Hyde theme by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I have decided to move away from Wordpress as I want a website which is easy to source control.

The idea of this website is to blog about the following:

* Current projects I am working on with clients

* My fitness and nutritional journey with Mark MacQueen

* General ramplings about football, coffee & music.


Watch this space, I have a lot of things in store during the remainder of 2016 and hope you can follow me on my journey ..
