### What is Pipeline?

[Pipeline](http://web.pipelineconf.info/) is a not-for-profit conference about all things Continuous Delivery.

I attended last year and feel in love, so purchased a super early bird ticket this time.

### Keynote - Jez Humble

So the conference kicked off with Mr Continuous Delivery himself, Jez Humble.

He spoke about “What I learned from three years of sciencing the crap out of Continuous Delivery”.

It was a fascinating hour from Jez, he said many quotes which really hit home to me.

1. What we do not want to know is WHO made the mistake, you need to know WHY the mistake was made.

2. People redefine the meaning of "Continuous Integration" in order to say that they are doing it.

3. Based on the results from [2015 state of DevOps report](https://puppetlabs.com/2015-devops-report) IT performance really does matter.

He also spoke about the [Westrum Typology](https://www.andykelk.net/devops/using-the-westrum-typology-to-measure-culture) regarding the topology of organisational culture.

Finally he suggested people take the [2016 state of DevOps report](https://go.devops-survey.com/index.html?survey_id) so get on with it ;)


### Finally meeting Ken Mugrage (@kmugrage)

After a long time speaking online via Twitter and Slack I finally got to meet the Ken in the flesh.

The guy has been so helpful when it comes to tools such as [Go.cd](https://www.go.cd/) and [SnapCI](https://www.snap-ci.com/)

He also told me that Mr Humble himself was the product owner for Go.cd two years before we wrote the book Continuous Delivery.

This makes sense as the tool lends itself very well to the software.

Ken, until next time, it was a pleasure my friend.
