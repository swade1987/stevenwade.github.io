Things kicked off with Matthew Skelton talking quickly about the sponsors and fire safety.

### Keynote - Jez Humble

So the conference kicked off with Mr Continuous Delivery himself, Jez Humble.

He spoke about “What I learned from three years of sciencing the crap out of Continuous Delivery”.

It was a facinating hour from Jez, he said many quotes which really hit home to me.

1. What we do not want to know is WHO made the mistake, you need to know WHY the mistake was made.

2. People redefine the meaning of "Continuous Integration" in order to say that they are doing it.

3. Based on the results from [2015 state of DevOps report](https://puppetlabs.com/2015-devops-report) IT performance really does matter.

He also spoke about the [Westrum Typology] (https://www.andykelk.net/devops/using-the-westrum-typology-to-measure-culture) regarding the topology of organisational culture.

Finally he suggested people take the [2016 state of DevOps report] (https://go.devops-survey.com/index.html?survey_id) so get on with it ;)
