So after 16 months working with the Parliamentary Digital Service we have finally parted ways.
The following blog post will detail some of the work I did their and what they are trying to achieve.

### Who are the Parliamentary Digital Service?

The Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS), are a joint department of both Houses of Parliament, providing technology and intranet services to Members and their staff.
They currently blog at [https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/)

### What was I brought back to do?

Initial I was bought back to work on a greenfield project entitled LAS (Lords Amendment System)

The aim of the project was to provide a system which allowed Members and their staff to table Amendments to Bills digitally.
