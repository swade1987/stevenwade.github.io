title: From contract to perm, but why?

So after 16 months working with the Parliamentary Digital Service we finally parted ways.<br>
After a week break to spend quality time with the family,<br>
I took a short term remote contract with [Zesty Ltd](https://www.zesty.co.uk/pages/about-zesty) to help them with two things:

1. To "dockerise" their applications
2. To create them a containerised platform on [Redcentric](http://www.redcentricplc.com/services/infrastructure/iaas/)

Note: This role will be coming to an end this week and I will be starting my new adventure very soon.

### Interviews

My updated CV seemed to be getting a lot of attention and therefore I was being put forward for a number of different roles.

In the space of a week I think I had something like 15 - 20 telephone interviews.

I eventually whittled it done to two main roles I was interested in so I attended face-to-face interviews with these companies.

After leaving the interviews I knew I had smashed both of them and was confident of getting offered the roles.

Note: These two roles were both contracts paying an awesome day rate with a contract length of at least six months.

### Twitter

Then out of the blue [Joseph Jack](https://twitter.com/asynchio) messaged me on Twitter.

He said he heard me talk at the last [Hashicorp User Group meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-HashiCorp-User-Group/events/232274563/) but didn't have time to speak to me.

We arranged a call via Skype the following day and he spoke to me about how impressed he was with my enthusiasm towards the cloud, containers, Continuous Delivery & DevOps.

I then met Rene Hermes & Ryan J Thomas (from Apprenda) for lunch in London where they spoke to me about [Apprenda](https://apprenda.com/)

They seemed to be impressed by what I was saying and wanted me to have another interview/chat via Skype with:

* Bryan Gregorius (Customer Solutions Architect)
* Mark Abrams (Senior Customer Solutions Architect)

This also seemed to go well and I felt pretty positive about the discussion, a colleague of theirs got back to me a few days later and said that the CEO wanted a chat.

I started to get nervous as I knew [Sinclair Schuller](https://twitter.com/sschuller) was extremely smart and Joseph have provided me with some ideas.

However, the chat with Sinclair was almost the opposite it was more like a friendly chat in a coffee shop over a Latte speaking about my experiences and passions.

It was refreshing to speak to someone that senior within an organisation in such an informal manner.

### Options

I was lucky enough to be offered both the contract roles as well as the role with [Apprenda](https://apprenda.com/).

### Decision

The decision was extremely tough both contract positions actually increased their offers as they wanted me that badly.

However, I eventually chose to go with Apprenda, people are probably thinking "Steve you're mad for turning down two contracts".

So let me explain my decision behind the choice ...

The opportunity on offer at Apprenda is incredible:

1. They are the second largest contributor to [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) behind Google themselves.
2. I will be the sixth employee in EMEA so can help shape the business out here.
3. I get to be more client facing which is important as I really like to engage in both technical and non-technical discussions.
4. I will be working with some SERIOUSLY smart people, hopefully Apprenda see me as "smart" too as they hired me ;)

### What did I learn?

1. I learnt that sometimes its not all about the money, its about the opportunity placed in front of you.

2. I also learnt that speaking at meetups and having a presence on Twitter is invaluable.

3. I truly believe that having a Twitter account and tweeting about your passions is way more effective than a LinkedIn profile
