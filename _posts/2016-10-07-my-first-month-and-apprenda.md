title: My first month @ Apprenda

Finding the dream job is certainly something not everybody is lucky enough to obtain. 
I can probably call myself one of the lucky ones. I started work at Apprenda as a Solutions Architect a month ago now. 
And you know what? I couldn’t imagine a better job. Seriously!

At the beginning of a career, everyone has their vision of a perfect job.
Yet, do you know how many people are unhappy in their work life? 
An unsatisfactory work life includes a whole host of issues: from an overly strict boss, to an inhospitable atmosphere, to dreaded boring projects to name a few. 
Luckily for me, these troubles do not apply, as Apprenda couldn’t be further from this.

To be honest, as I would be the only employee in the UK and the sixth in EMEA, I had a few fears before I joined Apprenda:

* Will I fit into the working environment? 
* Will I get enough attention from my new colleagues? 
* Will the boss appreciate my efforts? 

Sounds familiar, right? Fortunately, it turned out my fears were completely unfounded, and I needn’t have worried at all!

### So why do I feel Apprenda is so special?

The answer is simple ... the people!

More often than not, it’s not the place you work at, but the people you work with the make your job enjoyable. 
At Apprenda, our differences and distinctions are celebrated, but also we come together to work well as a whole.

Everybody’s unique perspectives help in creating the final product, or providing the best experience for our customers. 
What is important for me as a relatively young member of the Apprenda crew is I can rely on every one of my team in every aspect; in development and in daily live. 
I know that if I am struggling with anything, a Slack message saying "dude I am confused" is enough for my boss or coworkers to offer help.

### So what have I been upto?

You are probably all thinking so what on earth have you been upto in your first month.
It has been a crazy first month here at Apprenda, so let me break down the month into trips ...

### Rotterdam

The first day of my journey with Apprenda consisted of taking a flight to Rotterdam @ 7:30am so I made sure I was in the office for 9am.

I had packed my best suit and shirts and upon arrive to the office it was clear to see they had an informable dress code, brilliant!

I will only ever make that mistake once that's for sure.

My focus for the week was split into a few areas:

1. Get to know the team better.

2. Get my new laptop setup.

3. Continue to mess around with Kubernetes.

One of the things I really like about Apprenda is their customised 90 day plan for every new employee.

I have a set of tasks I must complete in 30, 60 and 90 days. Luckily, mine is pretty much continuing my journey with Kubernetes.

Outside of the office, Rotterdam was just an incredible city to be in (even in 32 degree heat in a shirt and trousers) the culture is amazing and the food is delicious!

I flew back to London City Airport on Friday morning, continued to practice some more with Kubernetes and that was the week over.

### Troy

The following week I was scheduled to fly out to New York to spend time getting to know the rest of the team. 
I will skip over the flight as it wasn't the best experience of my life to be honest!

My first stop was to the Headquarters in Troy. What can I say the people and the place were amazing!

I reached my hotel around 9:30pm local time and was invited out by a few colleagues to go for some food. I couldn't turn this oppurtunity down even though my body was 
saying to me, Steve you really should be in bed its 2:30am in London! 
Anyway, I managed to last a few hours at the resturant and a colleague even gave me a lift back to my hotel, thanks Ashley :)

So what were the highlights of my three days at HQ?

1. Meeting the CTO [Sinclair Schuller](https://twitter.com/sschuller) for the first time face-2-face in the office gym.

2. Meeting the Client Services team and instantly battering them about their lack of English Premier League knowledge! #MickeyRooney 

3. Meeting Jay Coon my following Kubernetes counterpart and clicking straight away, its like I have known him for years!

4. The incredible selection of drinks on offer in the office, the 3-4 different varieties of coffee was a personal highlight.

5. The incredible culture within the office, people high fiving each other and having a laugh and a joke whilst getting work done!

6. Interviewing a perspective candidate on my third day, he found it incredible I was over from London just for the interview!

Overall it was an incredible few days, I would of loved to say longer, can't wait to be back!

### Manhattan

On Thursday morning Jay and I took the train from Albany to Manhattan. The aim of this trip was to talk about new clients as well as for me to meet the team.

However, I knew Apprenda were hosting a [Kubernetes meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Cloud-Native-New-York/events/233772609/) at their offices in Manhattan that evening.

I noticed on Wednesday evening that [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) was in NYC, so I reached out to him to see if he was interested in coming to our offices. 

Sure enough Kelsey was available and came and presented a surprise, never-heard-before topic. It was an incredible evening, thanks once again Kelsey!

On Friday, Jay and I spent some time with Ryan (my boss) talking about new clients we were going to be working with new quarter and coming up with plans.

I had a taxi booked for 5am Saturday morning to take me to Newark Airport to I asked the guys if anyone wanted to show me "The New York City Experience" that evening.

Sure enough [Andrew Liberty](https://twitter.com/andrewlib) & [Chris Gaun](https://twitter.com/Chris_Gaun) came through and as they say, the rest is history!!

### Summary

In summary, my first month @ Apprenda has been incredible. I would like to thank every single member of staff for making me feel so welcome.
I can't wait to continue this journey with you all and lets smash the remainder of this year and the years to come!
