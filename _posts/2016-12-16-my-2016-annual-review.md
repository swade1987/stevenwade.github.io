title: My 2016 annual review
comments: true

Each year, I conduct my Annual Review, but this year I have chosen to share it publicly. I will answer the following questions during this review:

1. What went well this year?
2. What didn’t go so well this year?
3. What are my goals for next year?

## 1. What went well this year?

**Mentoring/Coaching.** It has been a pleasure to help mentor and coach numerous people this year. These range from colleagues to members of the Twitter-sphere.
There is something so humbling about educating those who have a passion to improve and become better versions of themselves.
I would like to shout out three people in particular [Giuseppe](https://twitter.com/sologius), [Rebecca](https://twitter.com/rklappleyard) & [Lee](https://twitter.com/ForresGeek).
It was a pleasure to teach you about all things Docker and Continuous Delivery, I wish you all the best for 2017 and if you need me you know where I am.

**Joining Apprenda.** After 18 months working with the great team at the Parliamentary Digital Service it was time to leave.
I went on to work alongside Lee (mentioned above) on a short-term contract with Zesty.
During this contract role with Zesty I presented at a meetup where [Joseph Jacks](https://twitter.com/asynchio) was present. 
Joseph was working for Apprenda and reached out to me on Twitter stating he needed to get me in front of the guys at Apprenda as I would be a great find.
Well, the rest is history and four months ago I joined as a Solutions Architect and I couldn't be happier.

**Public speaking.** During my role at the Parliamentary Digital Service I was presenting to colleagues pretty much every week.
Whilst at PDS my colleague at the time, [Vinitha](https://twitter.com/_vinithad) said that I should present at one or more meetup events considering I attend so many.
I therefore took it upon myself to talk at a London HashiCorp User Group about the work I had been doing at the Parliamentary Digital Service.
The talk wasn't the best, but it gave me the buzz to talk again in the future. Hopefully more talks to come in 2017, watch this space!

## 2. What didn’t go so well this year?

**Visiting family and friends.** I feel that during 2016 I spent too much time working and private studying and somewhat neglected my friends and family. 
This is something I will be looking to rectify during the coming year. Maybe the solution might be dedicating a weekend every other month to spend time with loved ones.
I have a calendar application on my iPhone so I do have no excuses!

**Nutrition.** I believe I eat a reasonably healthy diet, but—like most people, I probably think I eat better than I do. 
One thing is for certain, I don’t cook nearly as many meals as I should. I tried to limit eating out at restaurants to just the weekend and eat at home during the weekdays, 
but I honestly can’t say I stuck to that for more than one or two weeks throughout 2016. 

**Exercise.** Since my numerous knee injuries I have been way too inconsistent when it comes to going to the gym. Working remotely now has helped slightly but I definitely
need to get myself back into a routine of working out 3-4 times per week or at least an hour a time. It's not too much to ask, it just takes some time management and structure.
I hope in 2017 I can rekindle my relationship with the gym and get myself back in shape. I would like to apologies to [Harry Ranson](https://twitter.com/HarryRanson) for my poor attempts
this year. Hopefully 2017 will be the year of the gainz!

## 3. What are my goals for next year?

My attention will be focused on three main areas in 2017.

**Learn Golang.** The world of software is going Gopher crazy these days, with the likes of Docker, Kubernetes and the HashiCorp toolset all written in Golang.
Additionally, the [Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic) written by my colleagues at Apprenda is also written in Go. I would love to contribute to this and other projects
in the coming year. [Joseph Jacks](https://twitter.com/asynchio) please light a fire under my a$$ if I am not contributing regularly!

**Increase blog frequency.** I am learning a lot both inside and outside work and feel that I should be sharing this more with the community. 
Therefore, I want to try to blog at least once a month and maybe even get some guest bloggers to write some blog posts for this site. 
You heard it hear people, if you want me to blog about something please reach out to me and I will see what I can do!

**Improve fitness/nutrition.** Quite simply to get my a$$ back to the gym consistently (3 to 4 times per week for at least an hour per session)!

## What about you?

I don’t write these posts to brag. I write them because I find value in sharing my achievements and goals out loud and because I want to encourage others to dream big and do awesome things.

So, what about you? Consider writing your own end of year post? If you do, leave a link in the comments. If you don’t have a full post in you, still feel free to leave a comment with your plans for the new year.
