Hi, I'm Steve! I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur living in Kent and working in London.

I am currently working as a Technical Consultant @ Parliamentary Digital Service

I am leading the development of a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for their new website.

I recommend the following toolset.

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef)
* [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/)

The pipeline is hosted completely on AWS to allow for ease of scaling.

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/swade1987) to see what I've been up to recently!
