ABOUT ME
Just so you know a little bit about me, my name is Steven Wade, I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in Portsmouth & Whitehill. I and am currently based in the Hampshire area. I spend a lot of my time in London and Kent. I have been an ASP.NET MVC designer for about 4 years now, but a professional freelance developer for around 3 years. Currently I am working as a Technical Consultant @ Parliamentary Digital Service, in London.

AVAILABILITY
I am available to work on new projects at the moment on a part time basis, if you would like to discuss this with me, then please do get in touch and we can have a chat about your project in a bit more detail. I am also available for work with agencies across London, Kent & Hampshire, get in touch for my day rate. For times that I am not available, I do have several good friends in the industry who I work with regularly, and would be happy to put you in touch with them.

WHAT ELSE DO I DO?
I am quite proud to say, I am not your stereotypical developer who sits in a dark room all day and night, I do actually have a life of sorts! I enjoy going to the gym, please follow my fitness and nutrition journey in the blog section of this website. So I do have other things in my life that take up a bit of time, but without a shadow of a doubt, my main love is to “design, develop and deploy” as sad as that may be, it is very true!
